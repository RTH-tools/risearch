================================== RIsearch2 ===================================

If you are on a modern 64bit linux based system, you should be able to run 
the risearch2.x binary in the bin directory already. If not you will have to
rebuild the binary.

================================================================================


================================================================================
================================== REBUILDING ==================================
================================================================================

First, make sure that you have the following programs installed:

a) the GNU C compiler
b) CMake


=== Ubuntu LINUX ===

On ubuntu linux they are installed using the following command:

sudo apt-get install gcc cmake


=== Mac OSX ===

### installing brew ###

To install brew, that helps installing gcc, you need to execute the following 
command.

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


### gcc compiler ###

If you do not have the gcc compiler, to install it on Mac OSX you can run
the following command. This might take up to 1h.

brew install gcc --without-multilib

If you already have gcc on your Mac OSX, please make sure that your gcc 
compiler can compile OpenMP programs. If this is not the case you might
have to reinstall your gcc compiler with the following command. This might
take up to 1h.

brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib


### OpenMP libraries ###

brew install clang-omp


### CMake ###

To learn how to install cmake on Mac OSX, visit https://cmake.org/install/

After the installation, please make sure that you can execute cmake in your 
terminal by typing "cmake -h".


! HINT for Mac OSX: If you have reinstalled the gcc compiler, you might 
! have to change the line "CC = gcc", within the file "src/Makefile", to 
! "CC = gcc-6", or to another version of gcc that enables compiling OpenMP 
! programs.


===================

Now, you should attempt to recompile the binary using the following command:

./rebuild.sh


If that does not work, and you have the gcc and CMake programs installed, please
report back to the author.


============================= EXECUTING RIsearch2 ==============================

For more convenient use of RIsearch2, add the installation folder to your PATH 
or copy the binary to a location that is in $PATH.
