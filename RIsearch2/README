================================= RIsearch2 ==================================

RIsearch2 is a program for fast RNA-RNA interaction prediction.
It uses a seed-and-extend approach, applying suffix arrays in the first stage to
locate initial seed matches (allowing for G-U wobble matches) and using dynamic
programming to extend those matches with a simplified energy model.
