# RIsearch
RIsearch consists of two programs, RIsearch1 and RIsearch2

* RIsearch: a tool for large-scale RNAâ€“RNA, RNA-DNA, and DNA-DNA interaction prediction
* RIsearch2 is a program for fast RNA-RNA interaction prediction using a seed-and-extend approach

## Installation

First, make sure that you have the following programs installed:

* gcc
* make
* CMake
* libpcre3-devel

To build and install

	./readybuild.sh
	./configure
	make
	make install

## Executing RIsearch
Here we provide examples on how to run RIsearch2 and RIsearch1 with default parameters.

See the manuals for RIsearch2 and RIsearch1 for the full list of options and examples.

### RIsearch1
To run RIsearch1 in default settings use the following command:

	RIsearch -q query.fa -t target.fa

Alternatively, single sequences can be given directly on commandline with
-Q acgu -T acgu

Note: the files query.fa and target.fa may contain several sequences, 
RIsearch will scan all vs. all


### RIsearch2
First, generate the index structure for the target sequence(s) in the file target.fa
and store them in the file target.suf. 

	RIsearch2 -c target.fa -o target.suf

To run RIsearch2 in default settings use the following command:

	RIsearch2 -q query.fa -i target.suf

Note: the files query.fa and target.fa may contain several sequences, 
RIsearch will scan all vs. all

## RIsearch2 siRNA off-target prediction

siRNA off-target Discovery Pipeline.

	./scripts/pipeline.py

Script that divides the input target sequence in 100kb pieces, runs RNAplfold
with them and packs the results into a binary format to be able to pass them
into the pipeline.

	 ./src/run_RNAplfold_and_pack_results.py
