# RIsearch
RIsearch: a tool for large-scale RNAâ€“RNA, RNA-DNA, and DNA-DNA interaction prediction

## Installation

### RIsearch1
First, make sure that you have the following programs installed:

* gcc
* make

You can compile RIsearch1 by running the following from within the RIsearch1 folder.

	make RISEARCH

### RIsearch2

First, make sure that you have the following programs installed:

* gcc
* make
* CMake

Now, you should attempt to recompile the binary using the following command from
within the RIsearch2 folder:

	./rebuild.sh

If that does not work, and you have the gcc and CMake programs installed,
please report back to the author.

## Executing RIsearch
For more convenient use of RIsearch, add the installation folder or RIsearch1 and 
RIsearch2 to your PATH or copy the binary to a location that is in $PATH.

Here we provide examples on how to run RIsearch2 and RIsearch1 with default parameters.

See the manuals for RIsearch2 and RIsearch1 for the full list of options and examples.

### RIsearch2
First, generate the index structure for the target sequence(s) in the file target.fa
and store them in the file target.suf. 

	risearch2.x -c target.fa -o target.suf

To run RIsearch2 in default settings use the following command:

	risearch2.x -q query.fa -i target.suf

Note: the files query.fa and target.fa may contain several sequences, 
RIsearch will scan all vs. all

### RIsearch1
To run RIsearch1 in default settings use the following command:

	RIsearch -q query.fa -t target.fa

Alternatively, single sequences can be given directly on commandline with
-Q acgu -T acgu

Note: the files query.fa and target.fa may contain several sequences, 
RIsearch will scan all vs. all
